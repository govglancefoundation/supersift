# About Super Sift

Super Sift is a [metasearch engine], aggregating the results of other
{{link('search engines', 'preferences')}} while not storing information about
its users.

## Why use it?

- Super Sift may not offer you as personalized results as Google, but it doesn't
  generate a profile about you.
- Super Sift doesn't care about what you search for, never shares anything with a
  third-party, and it can't be used to compromise you.
- Super Sift is free software, the code is 100% open, and everyone is welcome to
  make it better.

If you do care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, or otherwise believe
in digital freedom, make Super Sift your default search engine or run it on your
own server!

## How do I set it as the default search engine?

Super Sift supports [OpenSearch].  For more information on changing your default
search engine, see your browser's documentation:

- [Firefox]
- [Microsoft Edge] - Behind the link, you will also find some useful instructions
  for Chrome and Safari.
- [Chromium]-based browsers only add websites that the user navigates to without
  a path.

When adding a search engine, there must be no duplicates with the same name.  If
you encounter a problem where you cannot add the search engine, you can either:

- remove the duplicate (default name: Super Sift) or
- contact the owner to give the instance a different name than the default.

## How does it work?

Super Sift is based off of SearXNG which is a fork from the well-known [searx] [metasearch engine] which was
inspired by the [Seeks project].  It provides basic privacy by mixing your
queries with searches on other platforms without storing search data.  Super Sift
can be added to your browser's search bar; moreover, it can be set as the
default search engine.

The {{link('stats page', 'stats')}} contains some useful anonymous usage
statistics about the engines used.
